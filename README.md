# Project_AISummarizer

## Introduction

This React Project can summarize URLs with RapidAPIs Chat-GPT4 Summarizer. The project uses React 18, Redux Toolkit, NodeJS and Tailwind CSS.

Please keep in mind that the project is for showcase purposes only and the used API is on a free license, therefore the API limit could be used up (50 Uses).

## Development Status

The project is still under development. I'm currently expanding it to a Fullstack MERN Project to:

- Comparing the current URL request with the MongoDB Collection
- Display MongoDB results if they exist to save API Calls
- Make API Call and create entry inside MDB Collection to save future api bandwith.
