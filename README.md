# Project_AISummarizer

## Introduction

This React Project can summarize URLs with RapidAPIs Chat-GPT4 Summarizer. The project uses the React 18, Redux Toolkit, NodeJS and Tailwind CSS.

Please keep in mind that the project is for showcase purposes only and the used API is on a free license, therefore the API limit could be used up (50 Uses).

The project is still under development. The goal is to have it connected to a mongodb database that saves the summarized querys. If a query has already been made to a URL in the past it fetches the data from the mongoDB Database instead of using up rapidAPI call-limits.
