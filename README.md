# Project_AISummarizer

## Introduction

This MERN-Stack Project uses Text URLs with RapidAPIs Chat-GPT4 Summarizer. The project uses the MERN Stack including TailwindCSS.
Please keep in mind that the project is for showcase purposes only and the used API is on a free license, therefore the API limit could be used up.

The project is following the work from Adrian by JSMasteryPRO teaching the connection of Rapid API in a MERN Stack Environment.

The project is still under development and the current GitHub Repository is still unfinished.
